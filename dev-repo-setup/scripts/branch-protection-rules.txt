BRANCH PROTECTION RULES FOR CLOUDINSIGHT REPOSITORIES
==============================================

These are the protection rules that will be applied by the manage-branch-protection.sh script:

For all branches (development, staging, production):

1. Pull Request Requirements:
   - 1 approval required for all branches
   - Code owner reviews required (CODEOWNERS enforcement)
   - Dismiss stale reviews when new commits are pushed
   - Require resolution of conversation threads before merging

2. Status Check Requirements:
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require branches to be up-to-date before merging (strict setting)

3. Branch Restrictions:
   - Block force pushes
   - Block branch deletions
   - No branch restrictions (anyone with write access can push)

4. Admin Enforcement:
   - Not enforced for repository administrators
   
Note: These rules are configured to enforce the CODEOWNERS files while allowing 
repository administrators to bypass restrictions when necessary.
