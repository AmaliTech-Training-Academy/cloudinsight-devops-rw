## üîç Template Contents

### Production Branch

The production branch CODEOWNERS file assigns ownership of all files to the production administrator:

```
# Production branch code owners
# Everything managed by production owner
* @bikaze
```

### Staging Branch

The staging branch CODEOWNERS file has specialized ownership rules:

```
# Staging branch code owners
# .github folder managed by bikaze
/.github/ @bikaze

# All other files managed by the staging owner
* @sntakirutimana72
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

These templates are automatically applied by the `create-repos.sh` script during repository creation. The script copies the appropriate CODEOWNERS file to each branch.

## üìö Detailed Documentation

For comprehensive documentation on CODEOWNERS and how they are implemented, refer to the main [dev-repo-setup README](../README.md).
